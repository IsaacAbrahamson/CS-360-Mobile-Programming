### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements for this project were to build a functioning inventory app that lets users see their current inventory levels for items, update and delete those items, and receive SMS notifications if their inventory level drops below a requirement. This app is intended to help small business owners and individuals easily track different items of inventory and know if they are getting low.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I had to create several pages including a login, register, item list, and item detail page. I kept users in mind by using layouts that they would be familiar with and that were intuitive to figure out. I believe my design was successful because it is intuitive on how to use the app to create, edit, and delete inventory items.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

When coding this app, I broke it down into smaller step-by-step processes that I could tackle one at a time. This process made it a lot easier for me to prioritize and start accomplishing tasks without getting overwhelmed in creating an entire app from scratch.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested my code using the built-in Android Studio emulator. It is extremely important to test your code, because there are many bugs that you can only find while running the app. When testing, I noticed a number of different bugs and parts that lacked polish that I could improve on.

### Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge that I ran into was figuring out SMS notifications. It is not easy to get a device's phone number, so I had to learn several different ways to get that information and then send a text message.

### In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think I was able to demonstrate a high degree of polish and professionalism by thouroughly testing and debugging. I took extra time thoroughly testing the app in different states to make sure that it didn't just work, but that it worked really well and seamlessly for the end user.
